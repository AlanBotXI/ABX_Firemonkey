This project shows how you can create an effect as if the form that is shown after pressinng 
the button were animated as is showing. The animation may be vertical (from bottom to top) 
or horizontal (from right to left), but you will be able to modify it easily if you will.
The main limitation is that all the forms that are shown using AnimateForm (the function for
the animation) should have the same base design and they must contain a TRectangle as background
